## üíº Work Experience

### **Data labelling manager** at [Ought](https://ought.org/) | _October 2022‚ÄìPresent_
 
 - Handle data from scientific papers used to train an AI research assistant, Elicit.
 - Manage the tasks necessary to acquire the data from human contractors.
 - Run calls to language models and evaluate the results.

### **Independent Projects** | _February 2021‚Äìpresent_

* **Freelance writing and editing**, see for instance [this piece on scientific style](https://www.worksinprogress.co/issue/the-elements-of-scientific-style/) for *Works in Progress*
* **iOS/Swift freelance work** for _Michael Olsen & Partnere A/S_. Debugged and added features to an iOS app used to manage car dealership audits.
* **[The Journal of Accessible and Well-Written Science](https://jawws.com)**: JAWWS was a project to improve the quality of science writing that is aimed at other scientists. I have been researching ways to make a paper less cognitively demanding, as well as examining how the current norms in scientific publishing came about. As of now the project is on hiatus, but visit [the website I created](https://jawws.com) or [the newsletter](https://jawws.substack.com/) to read my writing on these topics. Has been funded by *New Science*.
* **[Interintellect](https://interintellect.com/)**: Interintellect organizes intellectual discussion salons. I worked for five months to help set up the company's website (on Wordpress) and other behind-the-scene tasks. I have also organized more than ten salons, online and in person, since December 2020.
* **[Blog ‚Äî Atlas of Wonders and Monsters](https://etiennefd.substack.com/)**: I write a weekly blog post on various topics, now for more than 100 consecutive weeks. Feel free to subscribe.
* **[The Classical Futurist](https://classicalfuturist.com/)**: A monthly magazine to think about the future from the lens of classical antiquity that I co-founded with two friends.
* **Fiction**: I finished and edited a novel about New France and Quebec historical cinema. It's currently in the hands of potential publishers. I also occasionally write short stories.

### **Software Developer** at [Druide informatique](https://druide.com) | _February 2019‚ÄìFebruary 2021_

* Worked on a macOS app used internally by linguists to manage and update lexicographic data.
* Created new interface elements, measurements to evaluate data quality, and other features.

* Main technologies used: Swift, Objective-C, C++, Python, MySQL, Xcode, Gitlab.

### **Undergraduate researcher** at McGill University | _Summer 2018_

- Used machine learning and NLP to mine data from medical literature on vascular surgery and train a logistic regression model to predict surgical outcomes based on patient frailty.
- Showed that text mining can be useful to preselect the features of a machine learning model when there is only a small amount of available patient data.
- Main technologies used: Python, Jupyter Notebooks, machine learning libraries.
- Supervised by [Joelle Pineau](https://mila.quebec/en/person/joelle-pineau/) and [Audrey Durand](https://mila.quebec/en/person/audrey-durand/)
