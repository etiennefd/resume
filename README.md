# √âtienne Fortier-Dubois

Writer and programmer based in üìç Montreal, Quebec

I am a generalist at heart. Over the years I've been involved in scientific research in evolutionary biology, cancer care data, writing fiction in French, and natural language software. I enjoy programming and would like to work in a tech company with fun people, but all things considered I enjoy writing even more, and this is what I have been focussing on lately.

### **Independent Projects** | _March 2021‚Äìpresent_

In early 2021, I quit my software job to try my hand at various independent projects.

* [The Journal of Accessible and Well-Written Science](https://jawws.com): JAWWS is a project to improve the quality of science writing that is aimed at other scientists. I have been researching ways to make a paper less cognitively demanding, as well as examining how the current norms in scientific publishing came about. Visit [the website I created](https://jawws.com) or [subscribe to the newsletter](https://jawws.substack.com/) to read my writing on these topics. This work has been supported by [New Science](https://newscience.org).
* [Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/): I spent one month at the Cabin near Austin, Texas, as a residency to work on JAWWS. Since then I have also been an active member of the online Cabin community and I have been contributing some writing and editing work.
* [Interintellect](https://interintellect.com/): I worked for five months to help set up the company's website and other behind-the-scene tasks. I am also an active host in the community, having organized more than ten salons, online and in person, since December 2020.
* [Blog ‚Äî Atlas of Wonders and Monsters](https://etiennefd.substack.com/): I write a weekly blog post on any topic. In November 2020, I committed to publish every Wednesday for 100 weeks (until October 2022), and I have succeeded so far. Feel free to subscribe.
